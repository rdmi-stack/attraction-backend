      'A felucca dinner-cruise restaurant on the Nile in Garden City — slow service, live oud, three generations of Cairene boatmen.',
    body: `
<section>
  <p>Cairo Night Cruise was founded in 2009 by Captain Sherif Helmy aboard a single felucca tied at the Garden City Marina. Sherif's father had run sunset rides on the same stretch of river in the 1970s; his grandfather had taught Sadat to sail at Maadi Pier in the 1950s. The family knows the wind on this river the way Cairo cab drivers know the side streets.</p>
  <p>What started as private charters for friends turned into a dinner-cruise restaurant when Sherif's wife Salwa — a trained chef from Le Cordon Bleu Cairo — joined the boat in 2011. The first 5-course menu was served to twelve guests on the foredeck of <em>Nefertiti</em>, our flagship felucca. Word travelled. By 2015 we had five boats in rotation.</p>
  <p>Tonight the fleet still launches from the same two piers — Garden City and Maadi — between 18:30 and 21:30. The menu has grown, the oud players have learned new songs, but the felucca, the river, and the slow ceremony of dinner under Cairo's lit-up skyline are exactly as we found them.</p>

  <h3>Live Oud — every night</h3>
  <p>Maestro Tamer Abdelmoneim plays a 7-string oud aboard the larger feluccas Wednesday through Sunday. He learned from Naseer Shamma at the Cairo Conservatory; his sets blend Mohamed Mounir-era classics with original compositions written for the river.</p>
  <h3>Tanoura — Friday &amp; Saturday</h3>
  <p>Our Friday and Saturday 20:00 seatings include a 12-minute tanoura whirling-dervish performance on the foredeck. A traditional Sufi devotional dance, now performed for guests as a spectacle of colour and rotation under the bistro lights.</p>
  <h3>Quiet seatings — Monday &amp; Tuesday</h3>
  <p>Monday and Tuesday 18:30 seatings are intentionally quiet — soft oud only, no show. Best for couples and small private parties.</p>
  <h3>Jazz Late-Night — Thursday</h3>
  <p>The 21:30 Thursday departure on the <em>Hathor</em> is our late-night jazz felucca. The Hagrass Quartet (piano, bass, sax, brushes) plays from launch until return.</p>
