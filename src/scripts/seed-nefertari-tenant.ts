/**
 * Seed/upsert the Nefertari Cruise tenant.
 *
 * Third standalone boat-brand tenant under the Egypt Sunmarine portfolio
 * (designMode=nefertari). Three 40m floating Pharaonic-temple cruise ships
 * — 123 guests each — sailing from Makadi Bay and Marsa Alam. Gold reliefs,
 * hieroglyph halls, a throne room, costume banquets, luxury dining.
 *
 * Distinct from the `pharaonic` mode (static heritage museum) — this is a
 * sailing floating-temple dining experience.
 *
 * Idempotent. Run via:
 *   npx ts-node src/scripts/seed-nefertari-tenant.ts

      'How a floating Pharaonic temple became the Red Sea\'s most theatrical day cruise — three ships across Makadi Bay and Marsa Alam.',
    body: `
<section>
  <p>Nefertari Cruise was built to answer a single question: what if a Red Sea day cruise felt like sailing inside an ancient temple? The first ship was hand-carved over two years — gilded reliefs, hieroglyph walls, a throne room amidships, papyrus-pattern floors.</p>
  <p>It launched from Makadi Bay and sold out its first season on word of mouth alone. Guests did not just take a boat trip — they dressed as pharaohs, dined under a gilded ceiling, and were photographed on a golden throne flanked by Anubis. We built a second temple ship, then a third, and opened a southern route from Marsa Alam.</p>
  <p>Today, Nefertari Cruise runs three 40-metre floating temples carrying up to 123 guests each. The experience is unchanged: board a temple, become a royal for a day, dine like a dynasty, sail the Red Sea. Part of the Egypt Sunmarine family.</p>
