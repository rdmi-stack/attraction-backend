<section>
  <p>Luxor Air Balloon began with a single white-and-orange envelope inflating on the West Bank at 4:30 AM in 2013. Twelve years later we operate a fleet of five baskets and fly more sunrise hours than any other operator over the Valley of the Kings.</p>
  <p>Our pilots are EAA-accredited (Egyptian Aviation Authority) with combined 32,000+ flight hours. Our chief pilot, Captain Hany Mossad, trained at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta and has flown professionally since 2007.</p>
  <p>We exist because the first light on Hatshepsut's columns deserves witnesses.</p>

  <h3>Egyptian Aviation Authority Accredited</h3>
  <p>Every pilot in our fleet holds a current EAA commercial balloon licence. Annual recertification, dual medical reviews, and quarterly proficiency checks are mandatory.</p>
  <h3>Equipment</h3>
  <p>We fly Cameron Z-series envelopes (UK-manufactured) with dual-burner Ultra-Magnum tanks. Each basket carries fully redundant fuel systems. Envelopes are retired and replaced after 400 flight hours regardless of condition.</p>
  <h3>Weather Discipline</h3>
  <p>We cancel flights for surface wind above 12 km/h, gust spread above 6 km/h, or visibility below 5 km. Cancellations are full refund or free reschedule. Our weather window is the most conservative in Luxor.</p>
  <h3>Twelve-Year Record</h3>
  <p>Zero serious incidents since launch in 2013. We are independently audited annually.</p>

  <h3>Built for the lens</h3>
  <p>Our Photographer's Pre-Dawn Flight launches 30 minutes earlier than standard departures — you're airborne while the sky is still that 4:50 AM cobalt that no other operator can offer.</p>
  <h3>Why it's different</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum 8 passengers per basket (vs 16 standard)</li>
    <li>Tripod-stable shooting platform with locked-down corner mounts</li>
    <li>Pilot routes for golden-hour light angles on Hatshepsut + the Colossi of Memnon</li>
    <li>15-minute hover holds over the Valley of the Kings entrance</li>
    <li>Hot coffee in basket — no caffeine withdrawal at 4,500 feet</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Best months</h3>
  <p>October through March. Pre-book at least 14 days in advance — these slots sell out faster than any other tour we run.</p>
